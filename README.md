## Description:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Okay, I'll be honest, this is one of my favorite apps that I've personally built thus far! Everything from the font choice I made to the implementation of NASA's signature colors, AND the fact that I can see what NASA's APOD was on my birthday? Like...WHAT!? All in all, the HTML and Javascript side of the app was the easiest to pull off. I made sure to start by laying out the content I wanted in HTML, then I proceeded to fetch the data we needed to display in the app from NASA Open API (https://api.nasa.gov/) and finished off with adding in *style* with CSS.

## Lessons Learned:

While building this NASA app was easier than the previous API-based apps I've built, I feel that the repetition has deepened my understanding of fetching data/objects using APIs. Additionally, I feel incredibly proud that I was able to focus more on playing with the front-end aspect of the app, rather than struggling with fetching data/objects.
